      <p>Your mom and dad definitely recall the sequence of events on your
birthday, the failed birth-plan , how late or how soon you came, the frazzled
smile on your dad's face the first time he held you, most importantly the
command in your dad's voice when he was asked "What shall we name him/her?".
As your mom cried her eyes out as she recovered from well of course, bringing you into
this world.
      </div>
       <P>How about I tell you that we can teleport you back to that moment and
        giving you a new name based on these simple facts.
        <ol>
          <li>Your year of birthday</li>
          <li>The last digits of the birthday year</li>
          <li>Your birthday month</li>
          <li>The day of the month one was born</li>
          <li>Your preferred gender</li>
